## About Cards

Cards should be used in situations where users might need to:

- show condensed article information
- organize common elements
- call out information with multiple types of data

## Card Content

Cards make use of the following types of data/content in order, with starred* content required:

- Headline*, using the C360 Headline web component
- Image, using an HTML image
- Body text*, using an HTML paragraph
- Button*, using the C360 Button web component

## Card Configuration

Cards make use of two other C360 components - the Button and Headline.

### Buttons and Headlines

By using the Button web component, the following configuration is available:

- <em>Variant</em> - normal/base (default), <strong>brand</strong>, and destructive
- <em>Transform (NEW)</em> - <strong>uppercase</strong> and lowercase

By using the Headline web component, the following configuration is available:

- <em>Level</em> - h1, h2, <strong>h3</strong>, h4, h5, h6
- <em>Size</em> - x-large, large, medium, and <strong>small</strong> (default matches the Level)
- <em>Color (NEW)</em> - normal/base (default) and <strong>brand</strong>

Cards use the <strong>brand</strong> variant / <strong>uppercase</strong> transform configuration of the button and the <strong>h3</strong> level / <strong>small</strong> size / <strong>brand</strong> color configuration of the headline.

### Widths and Alignment

Cards have a configuration that controls the button placement with vertical alignment, where the following configuration is available:

- <em>Align</em> - stretch

This is only using in conjunction with the Card Group as a parent. Otherwise, cards take only as much height as required by its content.

Cards also have a configuration that controls their width, but this is only with the Card Group as a parent. Otherwise, cards take up the full width of their allotted space.
