## About Cards

Cards should be used in situations where users might need to:

- show condensed article information
- organize common elements
- call out information with multiple types of data

## Card Content

Cards make use of the following types of data/content in order, with starred* content required:

- Headline*, using the C360 Headline web component
- Image, using an HTML image
- Body text*, using an HTML paragraph
- Button*, using the C360 Button web component

## Card Configuration

Cards make use of two other C360 components - the Button and Headline.

### Buttons and Headlines

For the bottom/end button, the following configuration was added to the C360 Button:

- <em>Transform</em> - <strong>uppercase</strong> and lowercase

For the top headline, the following configuration was added to the C360 Headline:

- <em>Color</em> - normal/base (default) and <strong>brand</strong>

Cards use the <strong>uppercase</strong> transform configuration of the button and the <strong>brand</strong> color configuration of the headline.

### Widths and Alignment

Cards have a configuration that controls the button placement with vertical alignment, where the following configuration is available:

- <em>Align</em> - stretch

This is only using in conjunction with the Card Group as a parent. Otherwise, cards take only as much height as required by its content.

Cards also have a configuration that controls their width, but this is only with the Card Group as a parent. Otherwise, cards take up the full width of their allotted space.
